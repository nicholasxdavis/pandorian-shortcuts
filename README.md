## Overview

Pandorian is a powerful browser extension that transforms how you search and navigate the web. Instead of manually visiting different websites, simply type `@tag` in any search engine to instantly redirect to your favorite sites.

I built this because I was tired of opening multiple tabs, copying URLs, and manually navigating to different sites just to search for something. With Pandorian, you can search Spotify, GitHub, Reddit, Amazon, or any custom site directly from Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or any other search engine. Just type `drake @g` to search Genius, or `react hooks @gh` to search GitHub—it's that simple.
